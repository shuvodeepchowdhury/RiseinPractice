## Project Description
The Crowdfunding Platform is a blockchain-based solution that allows entrepreneurs and creators to raise funds for their projects from a wide audience. The smart contract manages contributions, ensuring that funds are only released once the project meets its financial goal.

## Project Vision
Our vision is to empower innovators to bring their ideas to life by providing a decentralized platform for fundraising. Contributors can support projects transparently, with confidence that funds are safeguarded until the project achieves its goal.

## Key Features
- **Project Creation**: Users can initiate a crowdfunding project with a specified financial goal.
- **Secure Contributions**: Backers contribute tokens toward the project goal, with all transactions recorded on the blockchain.
- **Goal Tracking**: Funds are managed transparently, with contributions tracked in real-time, allowing for public accountability.
- **Release of Funds**: Funds are marked as "fully raised" only when the project's financial target is met.
